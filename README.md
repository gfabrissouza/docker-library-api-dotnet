# Docker Learning API

This project was created to study and apply fundamental and advanced **Docker** concepts using a sample API as a hands-on learning platform. It covers everything from basic container operations to best practices in image creation, volumes, Docker Compose configuration, and integration with registries and CI/CD.

## âœ… Concepts Covered

- Understanding Docker platform components
- Understanding containers and images
- Running and managing containers using existing images
- Creating and publishing custom images
- Hosting images on Docker Hub
- Understanding and using Docker volumes
- Mounting and configuring volumes in containers
- Simplifying processes with reusable containers
- Creating development environments with code running inside containers
- Best practices for writing Dockerfiles
- Setting up environments with Docker Compose
- Creating a private image registry for enterprise deployments
- Dockerizing applications:
  - ASP.NET Core (backend)
  - React JS (frontend)
- Basic continuous integration concepts using:
  - GitHub
  - Travis CI
  - Docker Hub

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project was developed to provide practical Docker experience by applying concepts in a realistic scenario involving an API, frontend, CI/CD, and image publishing. It's intended for learning and experimentation purposes only.

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- ASP.NET Core
- React JS
